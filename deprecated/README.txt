The following python scripts in GitHub folder tierras_analyze/deprecated were used in early AIJ analysis of Tierras data. We keep a copy in case said analysis must be reproduced:

load_data.py
bin_lc.py
plot_all_comps.py
plot_cum_phot.py 

Current versions are available in the GitHub folder tierras_analyze.
